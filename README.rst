Submission for SMART. If you happen to be the interviewers, hi!  

This repo covers all of the work I did to create a presentation.

Actually, it might be more of a discussion whether or not these results are valid. 

The entry point would be smart_technologies_interview_presentation/presentation.ipynb 

The finished presentation would be [some powerpoint file located in this repository].
